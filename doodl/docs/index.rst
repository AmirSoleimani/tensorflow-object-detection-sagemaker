Doodl - Object Detection Library
================================

Doodl is an object detection library sitting on top of the `Tensorflow Object Detection 
API <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection>`_.
Its main goal is to facilitate experimentation on applications that need object detection 
as one of the components of the machine learning pipeline. Check out :doc:`introduction` for
